# React Web Application 

This Web Application shows information about parkings in Madrid. It is just a personal project to practice with ReactJS.

## Tools.
1. In order to get a better format, the *.csv* file is cleaned and transformed to a *.json* file using **Python** and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) previously. 
2. The application is implemented in **Javascript**, using [React.js](https://es.reactjs.org/).
3. The style libraries used are [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/) and [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/icons?name=fa).

#### React topics covered.
Routing, events, state, hooks, rendering.

## Functionality.
- Searching by district, area or name. 
- Show parking information by district. 
- Table with information of each parking.

## Data.
The used dataset can be find [here](https://datos.madrid.es/portal/site/egob/) (open data portal, Ayuntamiento de Madrid)

## Future work.
Use a map API to show the location of each parking in a map.
